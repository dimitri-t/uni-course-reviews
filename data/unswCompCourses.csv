COMP1000,"Introduction to World Wide Web, Spreadsheets and Databases",Undergraduate,"World wide web(WWW) dependent activities have become an essential part of our existence and yet many of us do not know much about how they works. In the first part of this course, we introduce the abstract features of the internet and the software that makes it so powerful. Knowledge about the architecture of the internet, world wide web, browsers, search engines, e-commerce, security, etc. will be helpful in using the internet more effectively as well as becoming aware of the several pifalls associated with this modern technology.
Spreadsheets and databases are two of the most commonly used and powerful computer tools yet they are often poorly utilised and the reasons for using one rather than the other are poorly understood. Many people purchase Microsoft Office which comes bundled with Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access - a spreadsheet and a database application - yet while many people have some familiarity with Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access is rarely utilised. This course aims to explain in straightforward terms the concepts underlying both of these powerful pieces of software so that students can exploit them effectively for both their studies and future careers. It will investigate how to design and implement effective spreadsheet and database applications. Students should also be able to transfer these skills to other, similar spreadsheet and database packages. Students will be expected to have personal copies of Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access on their own computers.
Note(s): This course may not be taken by students enrolled in an Engineering program."
COMP1010,The Art of Computing,Undergraduate,"Computational thinking is a critical skill in modern society. This course aims to provide you with an understanding of the foundations of computing, how software systems work, and how to construct new software systems.

COMP6721,(In-)Formal Methods: The Lost Art,Undergraduate and Postgraduate,"(In-)Formal Methods are practical structuring and design patterns that encourage programming that is easy to understand and to maintain. They are only a part of the large body of “good programming practices,” distinguished from that larger set because –for the methods we consider– the computer-science community has determined the science behind the structures: we know why they are effective.
Unusually, this course does not take the traditional route of teaching that science first, and then turning it into practical programming “tools-of-thought.” Instead, we teach the mental tools first, try them on examples and only then, once their effectiveness has been demonstrated, will we look behind the scenes to see where they come from.
Initially the material will deal with conventional programs, those that must “give the right output.” (This is known as functional correctness, and a sorting program is a simple example.) Later in the course we will look at additional correctness criteria, such as security (perform this calculation in a way that keeps part of the answer hidden) and randomisation (implement over-the-internet protocols that depend intrinsically on coin-flipping). Those last two topics will draw on up-to-the-minute research."

COMP6741,Algorithms for Intractable Problems,Undergraduate and Postgraduate,"The course focuses on algorithms for solving intractable computational problems, so-called NP-hard problems. Ideally, one would want to design algorithms that solve each instance exactly and in polynomial time. But since no polynomial time algorithm is known for any NP-hard problem, we will relax these requirements and design algorithms that either do not solve the problem exactly, that only solve a subset of instances, or whose worst-case running time is super-polynomial in the input size or some other parameter of the input.

Among algorithms that do not solve the problem exactly, we discuss heuristics and approximation algorithms. Heuristics do not guarantee to compute optimal solutions but tend to work well in practice. Approximation algorithms give additional guarantees of the quality of computed solution as compared to the optimal solution.

Among algorithms that only solve a subset of instances, we discuss graph classes where NP-hard graph problems often become polynomial-time solvable when the input is restricted to these classes.

Among algorithms that do not run in polynomial time, we discuss exponential-time algorithms and parameterized algorithms. In exponential-time algorithms we discuss algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case. In parameterized algorithms, a parameter k is associated with each instance and the goal is to design algorithms whose worst-case running time is fast whenever k is small. We will also see lower bounds for problems and how to rule out certain running times under various complexity assumptions.
